    <h2><small>Connecting Orcas Island</small></h2>
    <h3>Fertile Ground</h3>
    <h4><p><b>Fertile Ground is an experimental village project that aims to create affordable and low-impact housing options on Orcas Island that increase the surrounding biodiversity for climate resilience and food security. Housing security provides members of a community with the time and space to heal, localize resources, explore education, and realize the potential of all. </b></p>
        <hr>
        
        <p>We aim to organize landowners, donors, and affinity groups together to create low and no income housing communities. Our first neighborhood shared space is currently in the works. This space will model housing options in different price ranges and host educational events. We hope to eventually expand our project by transitioning what we have learned into the public sphere and obtaining rule variances to try experimental natural building and composting methods. Recently, state legislation (HB-1220) was passed that requires our county to ensure adequate housing is available for every income level, including transitional and emergency housing. There are certain groups on the island actively fighting against low and no-income housing because they think it will be unsightly and disturb ecosystems, but we hope to find solutions that will balance the needs of people and the environment. </p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>No income:</b> In my personal experience, I have met a lot of skilled and self motivated individuals who just don’t conform well to a typical job. Disabilities, sensitivities, and burn out require constant self-regulation that is hard to mold to a typical 9-5. Some types are just more cut out for a barter society where they can receive and give care to others, create resources, teach skills, or maintain a system in a self paced way. These people can make great on-site staff while work-trading for housing. The stability, as well as access to tools, materials, and education, provides opportunities to make an income, transition out of a work trade, and jump into a more serious passion. 
        <li><b>Low income:</b> This is the most widespread need and includes workers in the service industry, long term locals, and their families. Usually, a classic trailer park would be established, but in order to preserve Orcas’s rustic appeal, tiny house villages (comprising premade and moveable units) could be built instead. The monthly cost of the plot would include utilities (with the option to sell solar power back to OPALCO), a (variable) percentage cut of their taxable income (for maintenance, land taxes, and to insure it is only worth it for low income people to apply) and an added fee if the person is financing their tiny home. People could apply as a group, or as individuals. Tiny homes would have a unified theme determined by the neighborhood, and meet a set of loose aesthetic requirements set by Ripple Rock. Each village would have a stewardship plan to leave the land more alive than when they found it. Everyone owns their own house, so if there is a social dispute that cannot be solved, or a change in interest, individuals can apply to live in a different village or move onto private land. The setup is simple: every plot has power, water, a composting toilet (to create “humanure” to amend forest soil and fertilize fruit trees), and access to gardens, nature, and workspaces. 
        <li><b>Retirees:</b> It’s beneficial for older folks looking to downsize to live around young people who are trying to make something for themselves. We found in our survey that many retired folks want to teach something and feel a continued sense of social purpose. Villages with communal spaces are perfect places for natural mentorship, continuing education, and childcare. 
        <li><b>Seasonal Workers</b> Camping platforms, electric hook ups, shared kitchen, bathroom, and vehicle lot. Bell tents, canvas tents, and yurts would be taken down at the end of season.
        </ul>
        <p><b>We hope that these projects will grow naturally as we find the people, spaces, and funding for them. If you know of any resources that could be allocated towards any projects like these, let’s have a conversation!</b></p>
        
        
        <ul>
        <li><b>Emergency wintertime housing:</b> <br> It isn’t uncommon on this island for a person to have their housing pulled out from under them. Cheap housing options are scarce, so many tenants enter into leaseless, informal housing agreements that can end abruptly. Unregulated rentals don’t have  to provide proper amenities.  If a tenant gets forcibly evicted, or has to leave due to abusive circumstances, it’s possible for them to live outside in a trailer or tent in the summertime. Keeping warm and dry in the winter is much more challenging, yet there are countless buildings on the island sitting empty in the winter, whether they are vacation rentals, off-season resort cottages, or second homes. We want to identify spaces that could be reserved for 1-3 month winter rentals for local folks who suddenly have nowhere else to go. 
        
        <li><b>Sanctuary spaces:</b><br> an even more temporary space, for people to re-assemble themselves during a big transition, emergency, or as needed for peace of mind. This would be a natural preserve or land trust, with lightly perched buildings and camping platforms. The focus would be on self care and meditation, where people can learn techniques to create more stable rhythms in their lives. It is important for the stewards of this place to be dedicated to a life of curiosity and mindful practices. Access to this space would be time limited and by donation.
        
        <li><b>Neighborhood community centers:</b><br>
        The main hall would be an open floor space for workshops and events. It could host dance classes, group therapy, community meetings, a dojo, barter fair, film screenings, live performances and more! Rent would be the cost of maintaining the space. The walls would showcase local art and things produced from the maker's spaces.
        
        <li><b>Low rent commercial kitchens:</b><br>
        A low-cost commercial kitchen rental would enable folks to preserve food together en masse, host pop-up restaurants, and create homemade goods that are prepared legally for public sale and consumption.
        
        <li><b>STEM centers:</b><br>
        A surprising amount of people on this island want to teach or learn science, technology, engineering and math. An open lab and mentorship program could be the creative freedom we need to solve pressing environmental issues as well as uncover the nuanced ways climate change is affecting our local species. Everyone has the ability to learn, even if traditional schooling isn’t an option for them. The opportunity to limitlessly explore one's curiosity is rare, but could result in life-altering discoveries in renewable energy, health, climate resilience, and automation. 
        
        <li><b>Makerspaces:</b><br>
        Have you ever wanted to try something but didn’t have the capital to invest in an entire set up? A community art studio would allow folks to try lots of creative things and discover their craft. It could employ teachers, store supply donations, distribute island-made products and host space for an art gallery. Because the makerspace would be adjacent to the STEM center and 3d printer, it would be easy to combine artistic design, science, and technology. 
        
        <li><b>Public Beaches/Parks:</b><br>
        As it stands, most of the beaches on Orcas are private. A lot of these beaches are only used 1/4th of the year by very few people. Walking on these beaches can result in being scolded or even shot at. There are some potential village sites that would provide great local access to beaches, for the purpose of preservation, research, and ocean farming. 
        
        
        
        <li><b>Seaweed Farms:</b><br>
        Greenwave is an organization that gives people the tools to set up regenerative ocean farming.
        
        “GreenWave’s polyculture farming system grows a mix of seaweeds and shellfish that require zero inputs—making it the most sustainable form of food production on the planet—while sequestering carbon and rebuilding reef ecosystems. Since our farms sit vertically below the surface, they produce high yields with a small footprint. With a low barrier to entry, anyone with 20 acres, a boat, and $20-50K can start their own farm.”
        
        An ocean farm would create habitat and food for dwindling wildlife populations, and tending it would result in rewarding reciprocal relationships between people and wildlife, just like our ancient ancestors used to have. 
        
        
        <li><b>Diversity Scholarships:</b><br>
        Many islanders preach support for people of color, but our spaces are financially inaccessible. Affordable housing is limited and usually taken up by established residents. If there are homesteading, healing, and nature connection programs, as many scholarships as possible should be given to local tribes and those who have been systematically stripped of opportunity. 
        
        <li><b>Scouts:</b><br>
        Scouts could be an all-ages nature connection experience that fosters self-discovery through community building. Folks would gather weekly around a fire to talk, play games, practice survival skills, expand their sensory awareness, and explore forest farming. Each meeting would be different depending on the seasons and instructor. Every scout would have the opportunity to teach something they are passionate about. This group would help facilitate island wide nature awareness games. 
        
        <li><b>Garden and skill building programs:</b><br>
        These programs would take anyone who wants to learn how to become completely self sufficient. Sign-ups would open January first. Participants could either garden at home, or have a plot on shared land. An on-site class or mentorship opportunity would be available for every step of the planting, growing, harvesting, and preserving process. The winter would focus on traditional skills and crafts.
        
        <li><b>EcoTourism Activities:</b><br>
        Kayak tours, camping space rentals, weekend workshops, guided hiking tours, and festivals could all supply income. 
        
        <li><b>Affordable Showers/Laundry Rooms:</b><br>
        A key card connected to an account could give folks 24/7 access to laundry and showers. The only laundromat on the island is very expensive. 
        
        <li><b>Smoke and Cold Weather Shelters:</b><br>
        Bunk beds could fold down off walls to be used as an emergency shelter.
        </ul>

        
        <hr>
        
        <p><b>How will this help soothe the mental health crisis?</b></p><br>
        <p>Due to gentrification, empty houses, and vacation rentals, the working class on Orcas often struggle to find year round affordable housing. When someone is living in transitional housing, constantly moving from place to place, they don’t have a solid foundation for self-care or personal development. Spending excess time and money dealing with the day-to-day inconveniences of poverty can lead to burnout as well as periods of homelessness. </p>
        
        <p>Small spaces lack room to move and stretch the body. Many “low cost” rentals are without hot running water, making hygiene and dishes a major inconvenience. The public laundromat is very expensive. It’s hard to start a local business or sell homemade goods with high rent or cramped non-commercial kitchen spaces. Gardening to save money isn’t an option for people in apartments or rentals, and previously essential homesteading skills have been lost to modern convenience. Learning the skills to provide fully for oneself is challenging in unstable living conditions.</p>
        
        <p>Past traumas can leave a person feeling that they are unworthy of help. Acknowledgment from the community that healing is a right is crucial, and is exemplified by supporting free public therapy programs.</p>
        
        <p>A “do it alone” culture perpetuates social isolation and relapse. Without programs to integrate people into the community and towards a path of self-betterment, social workers quickly burn out. It’s hard for one person to take on the work of a whole village. When there is a central space that attracts every demographic, cross-cultural healing can happen. Perspective is gained by seeing how our individual actions ripple within a community. We discover our passions when we see ourselves mirrored in others, but unfortunately, some groups of islanders never cross paths. </p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>How will this have an impact on systematic oppression?</p></b><br>
        <p>Trauma and privilege are passed down generationally through cycles of poverty (like a lack of inherited wealth), and missed opportunities due to biases within people of power. There are a lot of wealthy white folks here who have consistent individualized health care, family acreage, higher education, and political power. In an equitable society, the demographics of wealth and power would not be so disproportionate to the actual population. Every person has the same amount of time in a day, so excessive wealth can't be sourced by hard work alone. The feeling of scarcity comes from people in power exploiting the labor of the working class and profiting off people who don’t have their own resources.</p>
        
        <p>Community spaces provide platforms to share our abundance and cultural practices that negate this inequality. </p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>How will this support local business?</b></p><br>
        <p>A low-cost commercial kitchen will provide a space where edible goods can be legally produced for consumption. Locals can try out restaurant ideas with pop up shops. Local artisans can use the maker's space to create, display, and sell their works. Educators can offer classes with low overhead costs, and experimental ways of living would draw in tourists. </p>
        <hr>
        <p></b>How will this empower and prepare island youth?</b></p><br>
        <p>Kids will have the same access to public spaces and programs as adults, with equal rights to materials, learning opportunities or speaking space as their elders. We want to teach them that they have the power to build a future they want to live in. </p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>How will order be maintained?</b></p><br>
        <p>Sign-ups for housing, garden plots and program slots would be held on January first. This year-long commitment would naturally give priority to full time residents. Keycards for the shower, laundry room, and workshops would be tied to an account and recorded digitally. </p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Why is nature-connection so essential to the vitality of our island?</b></p><br>
        <p>Recognition and awareness of natural patterns helps us see how humans play a part in the big picture. Nature can provide endless beauty and inspiration when we know what to look for and how to utilize it. When someone knows how to survive in the wild, they feel as if the whole world is their home. They are able to take more risks for self betterment and become less reliant on outside systems. One aspect of decolonization is returning to a nature-dictated way of being. Most importantly, birds are cute and make people happy, and I would love to see more of them. </p>
        
        <hr>
        <p><b>We need places that not only serve a utilitarian purpose, but are also full of genuine warmth, wisdom, creativity, and communion. We need spaces for seasonal celebrations and energetic performances, as well as quiet corners to meet with a friend or work on a project. The village frameworks will be designed with care, but the people who use them determine their evolution. There are so many interesting, creative folks on this island, and we want to hold space for them to come together on equal and fertile ground — so that we may all learn from, collaborate with, and celebrate one another. </b></p>
