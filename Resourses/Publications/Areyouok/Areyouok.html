        I have family here. I made the choice to leave my corporate job in Seattle after being there for 10 years.<br>
        it's fine. I do, however, require a housemate to help pay rent. I have an awesome landlord. Housing has all amenities.<br>
        read, cook, hike, write<br>
        this covid-19 and all the state mandates and restrictions. Not comfortable spending time in local businesses because of the tourists.<br>
        play and screen writing. Foreign languages.<br>
        </p>
<p>69   2ys<br>
    the beauty, the community, the PNW<br>
    yes all i need<br>
    garden/farm, photography, kayak, hike, camp, bike ride, community service<br>
    besides my own self..  No<br>
    more about the local land and environment.. Spanish, to dance, how to roll a kayak, Lightroom digital photo editing, and much more<br>
    </p>
<p>42, 16 years this time. Left for about 12 years.<br>
    Spent summers here for visitation with my dad as a child. Fell in love with the community and beauty. Even if I wanted to leave i financially would not have the means too relocate.<br>
    I own nothing. I work hard. Don't get paid enough to do anything but make ends meet. Grateful to have a long term rental.<br>
    More local volunteer work here. More non profit board work. I currently serve on 1 board but have been on a few here.<br>
    Finances and the ferries and medical care.<br>
    I'm always up for learning more about abundant island living and maintaining our island.</p>

<p>70 years of age, resident on Orcas 10 years.<br>
    Retired here due to ill health. Am content with my lot and the island.<br>
    I am happily ensconced, with all facilities necessary.<br>
    Live!<br>
    Constant whining from those unsatisfied with their self imposed situation.<br>
    We live in a wholly open age, all is available to those wishing to look</p>
<p>I am aged 57.  I have lived on Orcas for five years.<br>
    I wanted to live in the SJIs to see Orcas in the wild for the rest of my life.  Same.<br>
    Quality of my living situation?  2/5?  Itâ€™s too subjective.  I have smelly water.  I do not have laundry facilities in my home. The place was cheaply built & I may have done things differently.  My place is pretty private; which I cherish.  My place costs $820/month; utilities: water (not soft, not potable & itâ€™s smelly). The sewer: itâ€™s a trailer type waste situation.  I cannot flush toilet paper.  It, too, is smelly.  I found this place after being homeless for seven months and am afraid to make waves as I know I am in a far better situation than a lot of folks.  I live alone; which I cherish. The electricity is sub par which is scary.  Iâ€™ve put duck tape in places that rat poop seeps through in order to stop it.  I do not have a lease.<br> 
    Never gonna happen.      <br>
    Sure. <br>
    Always.  Itâ€™s a mood thing.  Iâ€™m doing this at 4:48 in the am after insomnia won out over trying to rest.  Thanks for this.<br>  
    Hope something wonderful comes from the information submitted.<br>  
    And - that you all find value in this project. </p>

    I came here for a medical sabbatical, intending to stay one year only, but met my husband and married.<br>
    We own an older island built home with many continuing repair issues, but happier here without amenities I had in the suburbs.  I wouldn't change my situation.  Life is better here without the noise, light, and air pollution, but I worry it is changing with too much development and climate change refugees moving here.<br>
    volunteer in nature education<br>
    I have physical disabilities that restrict my level of activity.<br>
